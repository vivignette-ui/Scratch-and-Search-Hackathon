# AI-Generated Short Ad Pipeline – Module C

This repository currently delivers **Module C: a JSON-driven short video ad renderer**.

Module C takes:
- a scene structure generated by AI (Module A),
- a set of visual assets selected via similarity search (Module B),

and renders them into a **6–10 second, high-quality animated product ad** designed for social platforms.

---

## 1. Product Vision

**Input**
- Brand name  
- Featured product  
- Style keywords (e.g. dreamy, playful, futuristic)

**Output**
- A 6–10 second short video ad
- The featured product is always the visual center and main character
- Surrounding “mini-world / amusement park” elements:
  pipes, fruits, spheres, people, trees, ferris wheels, etc.
- Most elements remain static, with only subtle motion:
  slow rotation, floating, gentle drifting
- Clean, dreamy color palette
- Visual quality resembling high-end 3D render stills

**Pipeline goal**

> Brand + Product + Style → automatically generate a short animated ad with this aesthetic.

## 2. What This Repo Delivers (Module C)

This repo contains a working prototype of **Module C – the visual scene player**.

- File: `index.html`
- Type: pure frontend, no build step required
- Purpose: render an animated ad scene from structured JSON (`adJson`)

### How to Run

**Local**
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `index.html` directly in a browser

**Online**
- Can be deployed on any static hosting service (e.g. GitHub Pages)

## 3. `adJson` – Scene Description Format (Simplified)

Module C consumes a JSON object called `adJson`.

Example (single-shot demo):

```jsonc
{
  "shots": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "duration": 9000,
      "camera": {
        "movement": "slow-zoom-in",
        "angle": "slightly-top-down"
      },
      "elements": [
        {
          "id": "product",
          "type": "bottle",
          "motion": "yaw",
          "presetPosition": "pos-bottle-center",
          "assetId": "product_main"
        },
        {
          "id": "fruitTop",
          "type": "pineapple",
          "motion": "float",
          "position": { "x": 50, "y": 26 },
          "assetId": "fruit_yellow"
        },
        {
          "id": "wheelRight",
          "type": "ferris-wheel",
          "motion": "rotate-wheel",
          "presetPosition": "pos-wheel-right",
          "assetId": "ring_basic"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
